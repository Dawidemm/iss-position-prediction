# International Space Station Position Prediction Project

The goal of the project is to develop a system for predicting the position of the International Space Station (ISS) in geographical coordinate space. To achieve this goal, a set of tools and scripts has been prepared to collect data, train the model and visualize the actual and predicted position of the ISS.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Dawidemm/iss-position-prediction
    cd iss-position-prediction
    ```

2. Python Version:

   This project is developed using Python version 3.10.13.

3. Virtual Environment:

   It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies and isolate the project environment.

4. Install the project:

    After activating the virtual environment, navigate to the project directory and install the project using the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install .
    ```
